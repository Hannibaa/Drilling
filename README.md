# Drilling Project
abstract __ this project is private and source code still work on it, 
simulation of rig activity, drilling operation, troubleshooting, maintenance, prevention system-- both on human safety and equipments--, drilling program, clients needs, well plan, schedule, maintenance, report and archiving, by high efficiency c++ library boost, std++20, 
we will implementing modern architecture and multithreading, some ML or AI, will be plug in.
after 3 month we will publish flowchart for how project will maintain, and another's for technical issues.
